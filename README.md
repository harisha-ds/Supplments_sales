Regional & Platform Trends: Some locations and platforms performed significantly better, revealing expansion opportunities.  
Growth Analysis: Month-over-month and year-over-year trends showed steady sales improvement and seasonality.

# Conclusion:
The Supplements Sales Analysis project provided valuable insights into the company’s sales performance across different products, categories, platforms, and time periods.   
Using SQL and Power BI, key performance indicators such as total revenue, net revenue, units sold, return rate, and discount amount were analyzed to understand overall business efficiency.  
The analysis revealed that certain products such as Biotin, Zinc, and Pre-Workout were top revenue generators, while others showed underperformance due to higher return rates or low sales volumes.   
Category and location-based insights highlighted which segments and markets contributed the most to revenue growth.Furthermore, trend analysis through monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales helped identify seasonal patterns and growth opportunities.  
The project also demonstrated the impact of discounts and product returns on profitability, emphasizing the need for optimizing promotional strategies and improving product quality where return rates are high.
